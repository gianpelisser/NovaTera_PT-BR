        <Page social="4">Velika is the central nation of the Valkyon Federation, and its governing authority must be absolute. This is necessary in order to secure the safety of the people. If we allow the politicians to exploit the discord and misunderstanding between the races for their own interests, it will not be long before the federation starts to crumble apart.</Page>

        <Page social="4">People think nobles are indifferent to the lives of the commoners. I, on the other hand, believe that it is the responsibility of the nobles to restore peace and stability in times of turmoil.

        <Page social="4">Valkyon Federation must escape the grasp of corrupt politicians. Foul officials are nibbling away at the core of our nation. The race and creed of our leaders do not matter. Only that we build a nation that is strong enough to defend us all. It's up to a handful of our wise and just leaders to unite us all.</Page>
