        <Page social="6">I'm glad to hear Poihon's on his way. We can certainly use his expertise while he's hereâ€”we haven't nearly enough fortifications.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What we do have are dracoloths, and a never-ending demand from the Mysterium for dracoloth hearts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They won't tell us what they do with them, but it's not lost on me that if they're useful, the giants used them too.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hunting dracoloths is hazardous work, but the gold's good. Interested? Head south to Barbtail Coulee.</Page>

        <Page social="6">Thank you, &lt;PCNAME&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Mysterium will make good use of these I'm sure. What use that is, I couldn't say.</Page>
