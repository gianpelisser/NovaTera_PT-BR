        <Page social="1">Like any great sorcerer, Oshar tends to inspire all sorts of folklore. But only a few know what I know: "he" is actually a "she!"&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even some of Oshar's most trusted confidants don't know the truth.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Why does it matter?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="1">I do not question the motives of the great and powerful Oshar!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I do, however, try to give her gifts that remind her that I know her true nature. I'm making a feathered headdress, and...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You guessed it. I need help gathering the feathers. You're starting to anticipate the needs of mighty Oshar! In time, you too could bask in her wisdom.</Page>
