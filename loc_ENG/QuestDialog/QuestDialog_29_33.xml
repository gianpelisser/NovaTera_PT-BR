        <Page social="5">I...I didn't even hear it approach. I just turned around and there it wasâ€”the biggest, ugliest vulcan I've ever seen glaring down at me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'm not proud of what I did next, but what else could I do? I ran and I ran fast. Blast and damnation! How did it sneak up us?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That thing killed my comrades, my friends! It would have made mincemeat out me as well. But you...you can defeat the {@LinkCreature:29#8002#vulcan devastator} and its {@LinkCreature:29#4041#dreadnaughts}, right? Don't do it for me. I'm a worthless slug. Do it for my friends.
