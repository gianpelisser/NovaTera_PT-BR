        <Page social="0">Summoned to Velika, you met with Commander Seir and Priestess Ciebel, and were briefed on the growing crisis in Allemantheia.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They dispatched you to the high elf capital to meet with Commander Fraya, one of the high elves' greatest heroes. Fraya explained a power struggle was underway and she hoped the influence of an outsider would stabilize things.</Page>

        <Page social="5">Welcome back, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. It's been too long. Reports speak well of you, as I would expect.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A request for assistance has come to us from Allemantheia, from a person no less notable than Fraya, one of their most distinguished commanders.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I can offer no details, but be delicate and be wary.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also, Ciebel has asked to speak with you before you leave.</Page>

        <Page social="5">You have done well thus far, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. Velik wishes you to know that the shadow that threatened Velika now looms over the desert, and is darker than before. Be cautious in Allemantheia—be ever watchful for the danger that lurks in the shadows.</Page>

        <Page social="5">Welcome to Allemantheia, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. Your flight went well?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Desert Jewel is grateful for your assistance, as am I.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You must be wondering why you were summoned.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Very much."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="5">Power in Allemantheia is shared between the federation, the elders, and the Mysterium. It's a delicate balance. We need an outsider, and your name was agreed upon by all three groups.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Mysterium is pleased with you after your work in the Celestial Hills, and your own commanders exult over your cunning and courage.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"And the elders?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="5">More acquiescent than exultant. Still, that is a great victory. I don't want to give you the wrong impressions or mislead you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fraya waits to speak with you. She's not only our greatest soldier, but a true inspiration. Speak to {@LinkCreature:72#1103#Arshadh} first.</Page>

        <Page social="5">Elleon's new friend arrives at last! Welcome to Allemantheia! Thank you for making the journey.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are a number of issues facing this city. Some require a deft touch—an outsider's touch. Sharing power in this city is something of a dance. It's intricate, it requires exquisite timing, and if one missteps, it hurts for a long time.</Page>

        <Page social="5">As an outsider, you have certain latitude in how you conduct business. Still, there are skeptics. Your work will reflect upon us all.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not that there's any pressure.</Page>
