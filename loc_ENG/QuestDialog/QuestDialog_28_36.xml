        <Page social="5">The Scions of Lok still believe they can resurrect their lord. They are so loyal, they'll even sacrifice their own lives for the cause.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That may open up a particularly grisly branch of research to us.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Search for &lt;font color='#0080FF'&gt;&lt;A href="markmap:loc=7011#34177,-11670,4572&amp;type=1&amp;name=Tooltip"&gt;scion corpses&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/font&gt; and recover them. If we study them, we might further our knowledge of Lok himself. Naturally, we'll share all data with the federation.</Page>

        <Page social="12">Let's take a look at what you've found. The good news is they're definitely dead.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Interesting. The bones haven't turned black, which is a precursor to the body becoming a wraith.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instead they have a strange green tint. Is this a natural phenomenon? Something magical? If we could replicate this, we might be able to prevent others from becoming wraiths!</Page>
