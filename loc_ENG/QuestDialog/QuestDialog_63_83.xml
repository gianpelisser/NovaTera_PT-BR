        <Page social="0">Hey, I don't suppose you're on your way to the Creation Workshop in Velika, are you? I'm waiting for a weapon from them—do you think you could stop in and ask Santia when it will be finished?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Only if you happen to find yourself going that way, of course.</Page>

        <Page social="0">Oh, Velika's left...well, nevermind. I completely forgot about Jefaln's weapon. I'm absolutely swamped, though—it would really help me out if you could get materials from Thura and a design from Babur, and then process this ore for me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Don't worry, I'll make the actual weapon, and it won't take long, but it would go so much faster if the ore was already processed.</Page>

        <Page social="0">Hello! I handle reagents and parts, parts and reagents! They sound like the same thing. I guess they are, really, but everyone refers to them as separate things.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyway, you use them for different things. And in any case, I carry both. What did you want?</Page>

        <Page social="0">Designs, designs, I'm up to my eyeballs in designs. You look rather plaid. Ha! Ha ha!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ha? Eh, design merchant humor. You wouldn't get it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyhow, here's the design you'll need.</Page>
