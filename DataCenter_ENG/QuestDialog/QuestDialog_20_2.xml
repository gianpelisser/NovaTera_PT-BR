        <Page social="0">Samael is under orders to investigate reports of a new Scion hideout in the Tenebrous Mines. He dispatched you to Chebika to coordinate with the Justicars, but the search produced nothing of value.

He wants someone more experienced, but I think you can handle it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reports came in about a Scion base in the Tenebrous Mines. Meet Primus Jakarian in Chebika and tell him I've given you operational command over the mission. Sack the base and kill its leaders.</Page>
