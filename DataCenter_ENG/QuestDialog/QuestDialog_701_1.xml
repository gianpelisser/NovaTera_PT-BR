        <Page social="0">[Festival of the Sun]&lt;BR&gt;Every year, the Consos Clan hosts a festival for Balder, the God of the Sun. During this time, they ask everyone to assist with the duties of the clergy, such as cleaning the temple.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Because participation is not mandatory, the clergy are prepared to reward those who assist them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please demonstrate your devotion to the God of the Sun during this most holy time of year.</Page>

It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Festival of the Sun God.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please, spend some time looking around the Garden of the Sun, and do not hesitate to ask any of the Consos Clan where your assistance is needed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And when the work at the temple is done, and the sun's flame has been rekindled, there will be a great celebration, to which you are of course invited.</Page>
