        <Page social="4">The eldritch shards are what makes this region strategically valuable. It used to be so easy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We had a good rapport with the wendigosâ€”at least until the giants came.

        <Page social="4">Your efforts are appreciated. These remarkable crystals are used in magical shields.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If the Mysterium can make it practical, each federation city will be guarded by such a device.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We'll see that the miners' families are compensated for what you recovered.</Page>
