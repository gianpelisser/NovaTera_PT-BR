They'll have no chance against our counterattack. &lt;PCNAME&gt;, you truly are a hero.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But there is something else I need to ask of you. Those who died here...their spirits cannot rest until they understand that they have been avenged. Only one person can put their spirits at ease: the person who avenged them. The savior of Pora Elinu.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You, &lt;PCNAME&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please, return to Pora Elinu, meet with Sujai, and perform the Ceremony of Mourning.</Page>

Thank you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It'll take time for everything to go back to the way it was.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Princess Rida journeyed to Kaiator to petition for aid and left reconstruction of Pora Elinu to my mistress Arin. Word of your deeds has reached Princess Rida. She has asked me to send you to her immediately.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I hope you have everything you need. Please give my regards to Princess Rida.
