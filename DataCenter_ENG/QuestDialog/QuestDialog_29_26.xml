        <Page social="5">The tertas seeds have sprouted. Plant them, and they'll grow quickly. Please deliver these seeds to {@LinkCreature:229#1019#Karsonak}. He's south of this camp researching arachnen mutations. Tertas will definitely help his study. I've got more seeds to sprout, but at least these are ready.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Take them to Karsonak and remind him to be careful!</Page>

        <Page social="5">By Oriyn's torch, these sprouts will be most useful! I shall plant them at once.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Because this region is so out of balance, I am reluctant to slaughter my research subjects. I much prefer to dose them and let them wake up a few hours later.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Whatever the root cause, there are lessons for us to learn. Let us continue with open minds.</Page>
