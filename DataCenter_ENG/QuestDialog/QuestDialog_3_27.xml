        <Page social="4">I'm ashamed to ask, particularly while things are so dire, but I need your help. My dog, Ohdi, ran off. The kids told me he headed towards Berzerad Cemetery. I wouldn't ask just for myself. The other residents draw great comfort from Ohdi.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Take this bag. It's got a treat Esedran cooked up for me. Give it to Ohdi and he'll hop right in the bag. Please?</Page>
