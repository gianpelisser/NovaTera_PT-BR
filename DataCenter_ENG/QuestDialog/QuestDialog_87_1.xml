        <Page social="4">I don't recognize you. Did you just arrive here?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No matter. Any help you can offer will be greatly appreciated. We're having trouble with some orcan deserters stealing our supplies. Can you help out?</Page>

        <Page social="4">That was...something else. I mean: Thanks for the help!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Those guys are just rank-and-file orcan soldiers that ran away during the fighting. They've been lurking out there, waiting for an unguarded moment to steal from our food supply.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But you taught 'em a lesson and they won't be back anytime soon!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Where are you from, &lt;PCNAME&gt;?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;&amp;quot;You don't want to know.&amp;quot;&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="0">Heh! Top secret, eh? Makes sense: I'd heard we'd be getting some mercenaries to help us out! And here you are!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, you should probably report to Miayn—she's the administrator for the Honor Guard. She'll have your assignments.</Page>

        <Page social="4">You must be one of the new mercenaries I heard about. We've been waiting for you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Here: This is for helping Dorial. It's just a small sign of my appreciation.</Page>
