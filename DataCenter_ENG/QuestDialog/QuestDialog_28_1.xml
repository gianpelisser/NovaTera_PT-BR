        <Page social="0">Mysterium scholars in Blessing Basin asked for your aid after tales of your deeds etched themselves into ancient cenotaphs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You studied the cenotaphs and learned you were to face a great test. You faced the guardians of fate and met with the Seeress of the Gods, Mystel. She gave you a warning about the future and an ancient tome.</Page>

        <Page social="5">Hmm, now the Mysterium team in Blessing Basin is asking for you by name. It appears they have made an important discovery that involves you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Speak with Magistrate Jelren in Tralion at once.</Page>

        <Page social="5">The Mysterium team is most eager to meet you. They've been unusually close-lipped about their work—even for them—yet adamant about needing your assistance.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The team is still in the field, so head west to Crossroads Camp. Be prepared for anything. Their insistence is unusual. I assume their request will be as well.</Page>

        <Page social="5">Glorious! We've been keen to work with you ever since we read about your exploits. You've certainly made a name for yourself in your brief service. Small wonder the gods took notice!&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"You read about me?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="0">Your name, and your deeds, appeared on the cenotaphs a few weeks ago. All of your actions in Southern Shara are chronicled there.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You should speak with Ansine at Seekers' Locus. Along the way, read the stones. See for yourself!</Page>

        <Page social="4">Long ago, Arun and Shara, weary of war, left the realm of strife.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They lay down their treasures and raiments of power, and fell into a deep sleep. And as they dreamed, this world came into being.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I don't see anything about me."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">Arun's sleeping form became the eastern land, and Shara's the west.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Their tears became the ocean; their breath, the wind. Their dreams became reality.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(The stone continues to chronicle the Age of Gods, the Divine War, and the modern Age of Mortals.)&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;Skip to the end.&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">Among those to explore and protect this new land—this Island of Dawn—came the adventurer, &lt;PCNAME&gt;.</Page>

        <Page social="4">...and &lt;PCNAME&gt;, who defeated Karascha on the Island of Dawn, set off to the city of the goddess Velik. The city was threatened by enemies within, while the worshipers of the deceiver Lok brought chaos over the continent of Arun. Through trials long and hard, &lt;PCNAME&gt; exposed their plot and ended it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But for &lt;PCNAME&gt; and Elleon, the entire realm would have perished.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Fascinating reading, isn't it? We didn't believe it ourselves until we inquired whether the Valkyon Federation even had a soldier named &lt;PCNAME&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Elleon's exploits are well known. Yours, less so.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I'm not here for the fame."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">A wise policy, no doubt.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, the instructions are there. You are the "Hand of the Seeress," obviously. You must walk through the shadows.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Whatever test you face next, the stones will guide you.</Page>

        <Page social="4">The Hand of the Seeress must be tested. When fully prepared, the Hand may use this stone to proceed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beware hubris. Destinies are infinitely mutable, and the visions of the seeress guarantee no outcome.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is no fate but what you make.</Page>

        <Page social="1">And so we meet at last, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. I am Mystel, seeress of the gods. You have journeyed far to reach this place in space and time. You've been tested by the huntress herself, and now by me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have to know if you have the strength to go even further—to defeat an evil more powerful than any mortal has ever imagined.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"What do you mean?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="1">Our world faces a danger graver than anyone realizes. It will take a soldier of incredible courage and fortitude to face such an inexorable foe. This test was harsh, but necessary.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You surprised me. You can't imagine how rare that is.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"So I passed the test?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="1">The test never ends, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. Your performance, however, was most promising. We're on the same path now. In time, I'll be able to reveal more. For now, take this book and study its secrets. There may be a moment where the knowledge in here will carry the day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Stay strong in heart and purpose.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I will."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">Our destinies are intertwined now. The journey is clear, even though the destination is yet unknown.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have other pebbles to place, so I must take my leave. Farewell, for now.</Page>

        <Page social="4">The goddess of fate chose you, and you passed her test! Incredible!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do you know how few are chosen, much less survive? This is a moment of enormous importance. I must prepare a report. You should return to Tralion and let Magistrate Jelren know what transpired here.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Incredible! You met with Mystel? And you passed her trial? Your fortunes are rising!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The book she gave you is the Nelsiir Codex. It's said to contain the location of a terribly powerful artifact.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll send the codex to the Mysterium in Allemantheia for further study. When the time is right, it will find its way back to you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well done, &lt;PCNAME&gt;.</Page>
