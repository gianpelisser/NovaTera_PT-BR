        <Page social="0">Like most secrets, everyone knows about our secret research territory. So now some powerhouses have made alliances outside the federation's rule to control the mining and distribution of noctenium.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These powerhouses desire a pocket realm with their own access to noctenium. No one's tried to seize this one, so they must have found pocket realms of their own.</Page>

        <Page social="4">You want to join an alliance? I'm an expert on noctenium, not alliances. But if it'll get you out of my hair, I can send you to the cities where the alliances congregate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Meet with a recruiter in Velika, Allemantheia, or Kaiator. I'm sure they'd love to sell you on their power-hungry groups. Which alliance do you think you're interested in?</Page>
