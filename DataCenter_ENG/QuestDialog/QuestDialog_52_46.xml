        <Page social="5">It takes a lot of guts to fight Killian, the god of terror.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fear is the worst enemy of all, you know. It poisons you from the inside. The only way to overcome fear is expose yourself to it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You need a trace of terror, the essence of an extremely frightening experience.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"What's it look like?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="5">It looks a little different to everyone. That's the point, &lt;PCNAME&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The easiest way to get a trace of terror is to extract it from a corpse that saw its death coming...and feared it. For once, I suppose we should be glad that this place is crawling with the undead, eh?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bring me Traces of Fear, and I'll brew a potion of will for you.</Page>
