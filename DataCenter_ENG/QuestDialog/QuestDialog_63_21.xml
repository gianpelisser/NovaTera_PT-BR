        <Page social="5">Thank you for coming this far, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. Let me cut to the chase. Supporting the war effort's affected the quality of life throughout the federation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The federation's sending you and other agents to support the magistrates, gather material goods, and provide some relief.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Report to Magistrate Arn in Lumbertown. Show the citizens that they're just as much of a priority as the argons.</Page>

        <Page social="5">You're far too modest. I'm sure Magistrate Bisi will agree when he sees you. He's in Popolion, and in more dire need than we were.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;May Velik bless you.</Page>
