She's as tough as they come, but she's all alone.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She'd never ask for help, she's all into having altitude, but she'll take it if it's offered.

        <Page social="4">Yes, I'm all aloneâ€”now. My partner, Keleth, and I were discovered while scouting around.

Bring back his {@LinkCreature:203#1029#ring} that I might return them to his home and thank his family.</Page>
