        <Page social="1">"The Sun shall await two... Through might and wisdom, they will awaken a long-lost hope." Greetings, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. I've waited a long while to see you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My parents pushed me into the archive vaults when the god Balder died. His magic preserved us to serve his refuge and temple.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Only the children survived that day.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"You saw Balder?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="1">I was a child, so my memories are vague. I remember he was often sad, but beautiful.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I was too young to visit the temple, but I knew the ceremonies. You've earned this key.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When you are ready, go see {@LinkCreature:230#1074$$Botak}. He'll show you the entrance. Good luck.</Page>
