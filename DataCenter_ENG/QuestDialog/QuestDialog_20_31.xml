        <Page social="4">The {@LinkCreature:20#30087000#relentless bloodclaw arachnens} have taken over the tunnelsâ€”because undead aren't enough! I don't know when they showed up, but if they keep digging into the walls, the tunnels will collapse.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now, while that would be a great way to take out the undead, it'd also be a great way to take out our soldiers who are deep inside, not to mention the survivors that we're trying to find.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have soldiers and survivors to deal with, so I need you to head in there and take care of the spiders.</Page>
