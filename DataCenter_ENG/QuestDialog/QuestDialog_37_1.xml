        <Page social="0">Kelsaik rampages across the landscape, beyond anyone's control. Kaia sent you to confront Saleron, a god imprisoned since the end of the Divine War, and seek a means to defeat Kelsaik. Saleron tested you in his Sky Garden. When you proved yourself worthy, Saleron gave you the first of four relic fragments required to end Kelsaik's threat.</Page>

        <Page social="0">You must search for the god Saleron, imprisoned somewhere beneath Southern Shara, but speak with Tamur before you leave.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Vengeance against Killian...a luxury I cannot afford, &lt;PCNAME&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Killian didn't just murder my father. He took my childhood dream—leading the amani people into battle—and turned it to ash. I now command Kaiator, to be sure, but no son should be promoted over his father's corpse.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"The amani need you, Tamur."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="1">Yes, they do. Thus you must be the instrument of my vengeance, &lt;PCNAME&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You seek a way to stop Kelsaik. Killian seeks a way to control Kelsaik. I dream that your paths will cross!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And on that day, remember this: not even a god can thwart justice!&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I'll avenge your father."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="1">I'll keep Kaiator safe—an "orderly transition of power," as Fraya calls it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just stop Kelsaik before it attacks us...or before Killian and Thulsa get their hands on it.</Page>

        <Page social="4">&lt;PCNAME&gt;...a welcome sight. A firsthand account of the events at Sikander's egg, if you please...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;...so Thulsa has taken Killian under his wing? And they've turned Sikander into Kelsaik?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bleak news, friend. No doubt Tamur agitates for vengeance, but Kelsaik is a greater threat...greater than Killian.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Kaia said Saleron can help."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="1">Perhaps Saleron can help, but his allegiance is unclear.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The other gods imprisoned Saleron at the end of the Divine War, so he's no friend of theirs. On the other hand, Killian is Saleron's son.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The only way to know...is to go. The Mysterium have several research camps near Elenea. Seek out Elvar there. He may know how to reach Saleron's prison.</Page>

        <Page social="4">So an inquisitive &lt;PCCLASS:lcase&gt; seeks Saleron, creator of the prions, father of the dragons, eh?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Crypt of the Damned holds the answers you seek.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Know this, though: you walk in the footsteps of the gods! When the gods imprisoned Saleron at the end of the Divine War, they made his children—Kaia, Velik, Killian, and Icaruna—watch as they covered him in stone.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Kaia, Velik, Killian, Icaruna?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="1">How his children have scattered!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kaia and Velik have adopted mortal races and shepherd them to this day. Icaruna died during the Divine War...the historical record is sketchy on that point. And no one's seen Killian, god of terror, since the war ended.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Saleron loathes mortals and gods alike, but he spares some kindness for his creations, the prions. Most of what we know about Saleron comes from researchers like Legia who have spoken with them firsthand.</Page>

        <Page social="1">You felt that earthquake, right?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I was worried that Kelsaik was on the rampage, but so far it's just that tremor. Whatever happened, it's got the prions spooked. They're even less coherent than usual.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Maybe a fresh face can get something useful out of them, though. Try Torsten over there. He's supposedly their prophet.</Page>

        <Page social="1">The gods themselves have breathed on you, &lt;PCCLASS:lcase&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I remember the sacred words: "On the eve of the end times, pain shakes the earth. A mere mortal treads lightly, hunting the harbinger. A vision evokes sorrow, betrayal, defiance."&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus spake my ancestors.</Page>

        <Page social="1">Killian, god of terror, left countless minions in his wake, and now we few remaining prions cannot visit our imprisoned master.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Defeat these insolent fearmongers, and perhaps Saleron will look upon you kindly.</Page>

        <Page social="1">A mortal...pardon me if I don't shake your hand.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Torsten sent you—and you brought tribute, I see. That's good.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I also sense the influence of Kaia and Velik. I'm not exactly fond of my children right now, so that's bad. Very bad.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Kelsaik has risen..."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="1">I know, mortal. I gathered that from the questions Killian and Icaruna asked while they tortured me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If I give you a relic fragment, Killian will just overpower you and seize it. A poor strategy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you could prove you can stand up to Killian, though...hmmm. Perhaps a test?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Willing, ready, and able."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0">We'll see, mortal. We'll see. If you truly think yourself ready, I'll send you to a place where few mortals have ever walked—my sky garden. Let's see if you can survive the journey....</Page>

        <Page social="1">Since you live, you've passed my master's test.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Take the first relic fragment from this ancient slate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Would that Saleron could be there when Killian tries to take it from you. But as you know, he doesn't get around like he used to.</Page>
