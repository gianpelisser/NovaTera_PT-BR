        <Page social="0">The orcans of Feral Valley were divided into two sides—one wishing to continue to fight the federation and the other seeking peace. Karba, the leader of the pro-peace orcan group, requested you eliminate the pro-war group's leader. You fell into the warmonger orcans' trap and still managed to successfully accomplish his subjugation mission. But when the federation decided that resources for helping the pro-federation faction could not be spared, the peaceful orcans were left on their own.</Page>

        <Page social="5">This sudden orcan alliance has us backed into a corner. The only good news is that not all the orcans are part of it—some have even come here seeking asylum, if you can believe that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Grunath should have the latest intelligence on orcans. I'd like you to talk to him. We need more information to formulate a workable plan.</Page>

        <Page social="5">If you want to know about the orcans, I think the young orcans who've taken refuge with us would be a better source of information than I am.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What's amazing is that those young orcans are as intelligent as you and I.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'm as amazed as anyone. Anyway, go to Experior Outpost and speak with Kechaku. You might learn quite a bit.</Page>

If we could drive them off, the Black Claws might not be so eager to fight. When you're done, report to {@LinkCreature:241#1022$$Paduk}.</Page>

        <Page social="5">Great job. Total confusion among those warmongers. Ha, ha, ha! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But with their chief still alive, they'll reorganize soon enough.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Their chief must die. It's that simple.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, not exactly simple. Take this summoning flute and go to the tentacullar lair. It's on the right side when you follow the road south from here.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Inside the lair is &lt;font color='#0080FF'&gt;&lt;A href="markmap:loc=7013#-38952.0625,63845.6445,1011.6011&amp;type=1&amp;name=Paxomnia"&gt;Paxomnia&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Use the summoning flute there to contact our orcan collaborator. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He'll help you get rid of the chief.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bring the chief's head to our leader, Karba The Revered.</Page>

Now Gratuush and the rest of the orcans will lack the heart to attack the federation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Still, most will not listen to us, and still lust for war. They see us as cowards.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The federation could strike now and win, but I hope for peace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please take this letter to Prefect Lauma in Frontera. I have written my desire for peace. Perhaps the federation will see the truth of it there.</Page>

        <Page social="5">Honored Karba wants peace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Perhaps that's true, but his faction is a small minority of orcans. We can't spare the resources to help them unless we can guarantee that they could assume control.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"But they need our help!"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">Karba is eloquent, but his words alone won't convince Valkyon Command. I'll send the letter on to them in hopes they can see the advantages of having these orcans on our side.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Don't hope too much, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. Sometimes I think our high commanders are afraid of peace.</Page>
