        <Page social="4">Oh hello! Glad to see you again! We have received information about the location of another great rune - the Algiz Rune. According to ancient scriptures found in Velika's library, this artifact gave the wearer tremendous stamina and protection! So, let's move on to the place of research. This time our goal is the Golden Labyrinth. I have no idea how the rune got to Barakos, but he became somehow invincible, and an unusual aura emanates from him ... Surely it is Algiz who gives him strength! I really hope you can help me this time!</Page>
