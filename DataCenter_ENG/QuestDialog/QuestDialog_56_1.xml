        <Page social="0">Following Isrenia's warnings about Thulsa and Killian's plans for Sikander, you fought your way through Susurrus Woods to stop the mekonaris from kidnapping everyone, and destroyed the altar where they had sacrificed hundreds of their captives. Clues there pointed you to Amena Quatla, home of the sikandaris and the great egg where Sikander sleeps.</Page>

        <Page social="0">The ritual has two parts. The first one is at the Raven Altar. The second is in the Sanctum of Resurrection. You must stop both.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Look for advice in Dragonfall, then follow the trail of the kidnappers.</Page>

        <Page social="4">The mekonaris cleaned out Susurrus Woods. Human, amani, baraka...it didn't matter.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They herded droves of people down the east road, even the children. We sent all we could to Camp Umbra—they're in charge of rescuing the abductees—but they're still severely outnumbered.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Head through Nightwood and take out any mekonari hunters and ebonweavers you encounter. Maybe then we'll have fewer abductees on our hands.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Speak with Arshak when you arrive, he'll tell you all he knows.</Page>

        <Page social="1">&lt;PCNAME&gt;? It's Kaia's grace you're here. You know a lot already, but let me fill in the rest. The mekonaris think that all the blood they have spilt honoring Sikander will wake him up to cheerfully reward them. Idiots.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But there's worse. The ritual Killian gave them rips the sacrificed souls from the Dream. Unspeakable!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The mekonari believe this will draw Sikander home, but surely it will poison his mind!&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"You're right. That's Thulsa's goal."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="1">He wants to wake Sikander and drive him insane? You must stop them!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The mekonari templars and dedicants run the rituals, but there are other threats. Killian's dumped his whole blasted toybox on Susurrus Woods.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And we've had no luck so far using the altar teleportal. There must be some sort of key. Find it, and destroy the altar. Got all that?</Page>

It seems no one was spared.)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(Horrifyingly, the remains are all inscribed with runes. You sincerely hope the sigils were carved after their owners' deaths.)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(Suddenly you feel an eerie prickling on the back of your neck.)</Page>

        <Page social="1">You did it!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But I'm worried about the sikandari you saw at the altar. The mekonaris are apostates. They'd pay any cost to wake Sikander early, but sikandaris are patient, honorable. I assumed they were our allies. This kind of atrocity isn't like them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If Thulsa's duped the sikandaris, you better get moving!</Page>
