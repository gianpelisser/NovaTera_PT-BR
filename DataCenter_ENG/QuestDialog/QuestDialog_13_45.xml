        <Page social="4">Sorcha is a junior researcher full of crazy ideas! After listening to Eria talk about some ridiculous prophecy, she went off alone determined to tap into the power of the Tainted Gorge.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It's been some time since she checked in, and I'm worried.

        <Page social="4">Sorcha brought a mobile teleport stone with her, so Hermaiorni can do a clever bit of triangulation and teleport you there. But hurryâ€”who knows what trouble she's in?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Talk to Teleport Master Hermaiorni, and she'll send you onward. And do not forget to gear up for unexpected battles.</Page>
