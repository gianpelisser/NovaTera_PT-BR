        <Page social="5">Hey, there! I got "voluntold" and I need your help. The Mysterium has demanded I thin out the kumas ranks around here.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Have you seen the kumases? They're huge, mean, and bloodthirstyâ€”and those are their good qualities.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Look, I can't do it. I'm a lone warrior, but if you gathered some allies, I bet you could take them down. Kill an {@LinkCreature:7#3#indolent kumas} and I'll give you the reward. Deal?</Page>

        <Page social="5">Great job. As promised, here's the reward. I hope you don't mind but I had to take credit so you could get this. I doubt they'll ask for something this big anytime soon.</Page>
