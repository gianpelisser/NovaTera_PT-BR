        <Page social="4">The Red Lash pirates moved in force to Mistmoor Island. And they're spending more time on land than we'd like.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The pirates were actually easier to deal with when they had a full-fledged fleet, believe it or not.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Report to Vindicator Outpost, on the southern coast of Mistmoor Island. They'll put you to work.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Munam sent you? And not just to get a "left-handed wrench" or a "campfire smoke sample?" Either he's distracted or worried.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And he should be worried. The Red Lash pirates are everywhere. They're working with a bunch of gula slavers called the Kazuur Syndicate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So welcome to Mistmoor Island. Come for the sandy beaches, stay for the target-rich environment.</Page>
