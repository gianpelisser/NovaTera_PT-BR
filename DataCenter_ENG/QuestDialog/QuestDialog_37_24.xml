        <Page social="5">So the argons are moving upward from the bottom of the crypts. Not surprising. They weren't going to stay down there forever.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Look, there's no one here who can stand toe-to-toe with an argon...except for you, &lt;PCNAME&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ordinarily, we could rely on the prions for help, even if they're all crazy. But they're madder than usual, and determined to purify the crypts of anything that isn't a prion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, a sad duty is yours...on your way down, kill the prions. If a battle with the argons is in our future, the prions can't be in our way.</Page>

        <Page social="6">Grenan sent you? Last I heard, he thought we didn't need reinforcements. All those prions finally get to him?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oh. Oh, no...argons. That explains Grenan's concern.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No, I haven't seen any, and I hope I never will.</Page>
