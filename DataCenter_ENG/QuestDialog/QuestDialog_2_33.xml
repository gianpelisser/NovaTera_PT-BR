        <Page social="4">My father was a woodcutter, but he also had a soft spot for nature. After logging, he always planted more seedlings than the number of trees he cut down, telling me we should return what we owe to nature.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He emphasized that it's important to understand and harmonize with the faeries who also treasure nature and the forest. At least until...that...happened.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"What? What happened?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">My father was a good friend of the faeries in the nearby forest. Among them, the closest one to my father was a centaur called {@LinkCreature:2#203#Likhan}.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When I got to know him through my father, I thought that centaurs were wise and generous creatures.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But one day, my father went missing after he'd gone to meet Likhan. He was later found dead with lance and hoof wounds. It was terrible.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I'm so sorry."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
