        <Page social="0">&lt;PCNAME&gt;, I've been watching you. Your skills are impressive, but your weapon is sub-optimal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Look at the weapon I just gave you. You'll just need a few items to enchant it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Visit Valdrin in Lumbertown, and he'll give you what you need.</Page>

        <Page social="0">Enchanting, eh? I'll fill you in.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Enchant your equipment by combining it with feedstock of the same tier and some alkahestâ€”by the way, I sell that. Enchanting adds to the item's defense on armor, and offense on weapons. You can repeat the process to unlock bonuses at different levels.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To enchant equipment, you need to collect feedstock. You can do that by dismantling other gear of that tier. There's a button at the bottom of your inventory for dismantling gear.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You also need alkahest. Lots and lots of alkahest. Don't forget to buy some alkahest.</Page>
