        <Page social="4">Are you coming to tell me how I should give Khasib a chance, too? 'Cause I'm really getting tired of it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'd much rather talk about the insurgents' intelligence network. They're short on supplies and reinforcements.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now that they've lost their commander, it's the perfect time to strike.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"What did you have in mind?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">The most important members of the intelligence network are the {@LinkCreature:32#13#Sihran arcanists} and their {@LinkCreature:32#14#tuwangi froglars}. Just eliminating them will keep dozens of soldiers safe, but if you can recover documents from them, it will help even more.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Outstanding! If Khasib is so desperate to impress me, he could do something brave and...useful! Like this!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'm not saying he's not a good person. Just...not what I'm looking for right now.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bah! Enough about Khasib. Here's your reward.</Page>
