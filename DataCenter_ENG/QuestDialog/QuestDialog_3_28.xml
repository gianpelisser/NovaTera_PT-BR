        <Page social="4">(Corann, looking really troubled.)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Uhm... About Ohdi.... I guess Ohdi grew really fond of Undead bones while he was staying there. He wouldn't look at the food I gave him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So...I was wondering if you could get me as many {@LinkCreature:3#16#Fallen Defenders} bones as you can. I'm afraid Ohdi will leave home again if I don't get those bones. And if he ever disappears again, I don't think I'll be able to take it.... Please help me.</Page>
