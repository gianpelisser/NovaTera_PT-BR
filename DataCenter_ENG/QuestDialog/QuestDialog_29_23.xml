        <Page social="5">I was attacked by a troop of arachnens yesterday. I fought my way clear, but lost the leather crest my father gave me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It has enormous sentimental value and I'd give anything to get it back. Would you try to recover it from the {@LinkCreature:29#2021#leafcutter arachnens}? Even if you can't, their deaths will be some comfort.</Page>

        <Page social="5">Hey, did you find the crest? No? Pity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Still, with those arachnens dead, I can go look for it myself. Thanks for your help, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. Families are important and it wouldn't do to let mine down.</Page>
