        <Page social="4">Yeah, I know. It's the same old story. "Return to the safety of the camp." I don't think so.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyway, ready to help?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I don't remember volunteering."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="0">I volunteered you. I'm researching the civilization of the giants, but I can't find enough historical documents to get a full understanding it.
