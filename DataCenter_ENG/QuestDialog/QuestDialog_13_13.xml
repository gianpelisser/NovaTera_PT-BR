        <Page social="0">Prefect Riel ordered you to look into the whereabouts of the advance party. Upon arriving at the entrance to Tainted Gorge, you met with Scout Phaedra and learned that the advance party is safe and sound. Phaedra then said you should go to the Tainted Gorge Outpost to receive new assignments from Sersine.</Page>

Talk to Sersine and do what you can for her!</Page>

        <Page social="4">We're grateful for any assistance, of course.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The demons and their allies are indeed hunting for somethingâ€”and are a bit further along than we are.
