        <Page social="4">So it's &lt;PCNAME&gt;. I've heard that you're doing extraordinarily well over here. As you can see, there are lots of violent Terrons running around this place. They are usually not that threatening, but more annoying I would say. However, they suddenly became violent and are a serious threat to the researchers. Look at Kamarnu.
