        <Page social="4">That Dulari goes on and on, doesn't he? Let me tell you something important, instead of his talk about "pure knowledge."&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Every time you leave a secured area, you're just another empty pair of boots. They've had you focusing on individual targets, right? You need to practice against as many opponents as you can.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;See those {@LinkCreature:13#1#piglings}, &lt;font color='#660000'&gt;to the south&lt;/font&gt;? Excellent practice for what's over the next rise. I'll watch your moves and let you know when you're ready to move on.</Page>

        <Page social="0">It's a simple assignment. Go practice what you've learned by scoring &lt;font color='#660000'&gt;clean kills&lt;/font&gt;. On {@LinkCreature:13#1#piglings}. I'm trying to help you be a better soldier, 'cause we're all in this together.</Page>
