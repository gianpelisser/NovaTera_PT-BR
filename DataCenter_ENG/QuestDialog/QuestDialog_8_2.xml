        <Page social="0">While fighting gulas in the Hungry Caverns, you met a soldier, Detrian, who wanted you to deliver a gift to his younger sister. The sister returned the favor, sending a gift to Detrian.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then Detrian marched toward his post at the Hungry Caverns.</Page>

        <Page social="5">Gulas...just the thought of them makes my skin crawl.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It's one thing to face your enemy and slit his throat or spill his guts. But to eat your enemies—I mean, cook them up and eat them—that's just wrong.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kaia's Swords have been trying to wipe them out, but they're tenacious.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I can help."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="4">I'm sure you can, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. I'll dispatch you there immediately.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While I file the paperwork, can you do me a favor? Pass along these recall orders to Detrian in Castanica.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He's on leave, but we need him back on the front lines as soon as he can...well...extricate himself from Castanica's, um, recreational opportunities.</Page>

        <Page social="4">I know those caverns like the back of my hand, but...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;PCNAME&gt;, can you give this doll to my little sister, Hennika?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I promised I'd bring it to her, but I have to report back right away, so there won't be time to go home now.</Page>

        <Page social="5">My brother is the best! He always remembers me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I remembered him, too. I got him this charm, but now I can't give it to him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But you can! You're going to the same place he is, right? Just tell him it's a lucky charm, 'cause Hennika wants him to be safe.</Page>

        <Page social="5">A charm? That's so sweet. Just like Hennika. I miss her so much.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, better keep moving, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. Karina is waiting for you at Avenger Outpost.</Page>
