        <Page social="4">My husband died protecting Acarum. The {@LinkCreature:32#3#Sihran berserkers} cut off his hands, and let him bleed to death.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;His spirit haunts me, begging me to bring him some justice. I know what he wants, but I can't do it, and everyone in the village thinks I'm mad so they won't help.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It's such a simple requestâ€”just kill the {@LinkCreature:32#3#Sihran berserkers}, cut off their hands, and offer them to Batuk's spirit on Mount Tyrannas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Here, you may need this sack.</Page>

        <Page social="4">You believed her too, huh? She hasn't been the same since Batuk died. Haunted.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She keeps sending people out after hands. At least it's Sihran hands...and not anyone else's.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can we just keep this between us? Thanks.</Page>
