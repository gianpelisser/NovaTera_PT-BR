        <Page social="12">Killian's minions, prions, argons, and us...it's a mess down here.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Occasionally, it's a good mess. Right now, for instance, the argons and Killian's servants are fighting each other.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If they eliminate each other, I think we win by default!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I don't know how widespread the fighting is, though. We sent a herald, Geron, down to see what was going on, but we haven't heard from him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yeah, that happens a lot around here. Accursed endless, twisting caves! Can you find him?</Page>
