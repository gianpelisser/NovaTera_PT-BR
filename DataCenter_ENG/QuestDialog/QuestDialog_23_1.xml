        <Page social="0">The elin princesses Rida and Arin were locked in a feud over heraldry. The dispute over the new design for a Poporia Kingdom flag got ugly when Rida fled Pora Elinu and raised an army.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lienyn recruited you to resolve the dispute as the queen was unavailable. Princess Arin wanted your help to brew a draught to compel Rida back to her side.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Good to see you again, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. You've proven yourself to be capable and resourceful. Now we'll see if you can be delicate as well.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Kingdom of Poporia asked for you specifically for this mission.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"How may I serve?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">There's a dispute between two royal princesses, Arin and Rida. The queen is communing with the goddess Seren and isn't available. The kingdom wants an outsider to help resolve this, to avoid a political nightmare.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; If you ask me, it's already a political nightmare.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;{@LinkCreature:68#1007#Lienyn} in Pora Elinu has the details.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Greetings, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. Commander Seir speaks well of your skills...and your discretion. I need someone to mediate a dispute between the royals. It's an internal matter requiring an outside perspective.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You have a deft touch, I understand.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"How can I help?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">Princesses Rida and Arin are feuding, and the argument has divided the kingdom. The queen would normally intervene, but she remains in seclusion and can't be disturbed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Speak with Princess Arin and hear her out, but try to sway her for the good of the kingdom! She won't give in easily, but if this were an easy task, we'd not need you. Done ordering.</Page>

        <Page social="4">This is an internal matter, but I deign to accept your presence. You certainly can't make matters worse!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We're designing a new flag for the kingdom. Rida, that...intractable bovine, insists on a truly ridiculous symbol, while my design uses a more suitable one. The issue has divided us all!&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"You're fighting over art?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">Not just art! Our nation's symbol!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The officials voted to adopt my image. Princess Rida's simply stubborn. Not to mention the fact her symbol is a squirrel! Gauche.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The fox is a clearly superior symbol and resonates with our people. How can we not stand and fight?</Page>

        <Page social="4">The votes were clear. My symbol won by a full individual vote. It wasn't even close.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It's not my fault the squirrel princess is nuts!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When she lost the vote, she ran out of the assembly and went off on this foolish crusade. She's raising an army!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We need to stand united, under one banner. My banner, to be precise.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"What can I do to help?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">Well, first you can tell Rida she's being foolish and stubborn. Then you can help me make her a drink.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you bring me some &lt;font color='#0080FF'&gt;&lt;A href="markmap:loc=7002#-38335.6172,46082.5313,1267.9902&amp;type=1&amp;name=Dewdrop Buds"&gt;dewdrop buds&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;, I'll brew a dazzling cocktail. It tastes great and makes people much more receptive to suggestion. Simple!</Page>

        <Page social="4">Perfect! Now, we lack only something of the person we're charming.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Don't look horrified. This is my sister—I'd never hurt her!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you climb to the top of the tallest tree in eastern Pora Elinu, you'll find Sujai, Rida's maid. She should be able to obtain a &lt;b&gt;strand of Rida's hair&lt;/b&gt;. Bring that back to me and we'll be set!&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Why can't you go?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">Because I am a princess and you are not. It would be beneath me because...it's so tall!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now, hurry along!</Page>

Of course I could get that, but I'd never do anything to harm Princess Rida! I'm a loyal daughter of the kingdom!&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"No harm will come to her."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
