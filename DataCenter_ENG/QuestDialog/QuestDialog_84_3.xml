        <Page social="0">To all soldiers of the Valkyon Federation:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In these dark times we have seen our greatness and our shortcomings. We have known the joys of victory and the bitterness of defeat.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We are exhausted. We have seen our comrades and friends dying on the battlefield. We felt helpless and hopeless, but we rose up at the first opportunity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You have fought well and with dedication. You have shown the world the power of the Valkyon Federation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But the battle is not yet won. Join me, brothers and sisters! Together we will change history and send our enemies back to the world of dreams!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am awaiting you in Kaiator, with a gift.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-Tamur</Page>
