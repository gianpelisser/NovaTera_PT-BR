        <Page social="4">Many of our colleagues died during Thulsa's raid, and there was not enough time to take the bodies of the dead with us. The only thing I could do was gather the horns of our fallen comrades into graves of horns.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now I wish to return the horns of my friends to their families. Retrieve the horns from the grave and bring them to me.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Thank you. At last, the horns will return to where they belong.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kebal, Duka, and all of you...Once we reclaim the holy ground, I will take your horns to the crypts of your families myself. This I swear.</Page>
