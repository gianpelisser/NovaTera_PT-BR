        <Page social="4">We're starting to get a handle on things for the first time in months. So now it's time to strike back against the cultists.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Why are you still here? You're the closest person, so you win the draw. I have a written order here assinging you to {@LinkCreature:218#1009#Chenast}. Head toward Arena of the Exalted report for duty. Go, go!</Page>

        <Page social="4">Anaka sent you, did she? Hmm.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All right, then. Let's put you to work. It seems the {@LinkCreature:18#19#Lokian vanguards} and {@LinkCreature:18#23#Lokian magisters} are hatching some ritual or other.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Stop them before they succeed.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Those are...heads! Wow. That's what you brought me, all right.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, good! Anaka will be thrilled. She loves to decorate with pieces of cultists. Thinks it intimidates them. Might be right.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyway, pile them over there. Thanks for that.</Page>
