        <Page social="4">Supposedly there was a big riot to the north, around the Freeholds. Supplies were having trouble getting through for a while.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Don't know how much of a concern it is now, but it'd be useful to know whether any shipments of mine are going to get through. If you're headed that way, would you mind checking it out for me?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Check in with Teomath—he trades with the farmers pretty often, and is likely to have any information worth having.</Page>

        <Page social="4">That riot was pretty bad indeed. I couldn't tell you if it's safe to go back there yet—I haven't had the nerve to risk finding out.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You could take that fancy weapon of yours, though, and maybe find out if things have calmed down.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;&amp;quot;I can do that.&amp;quot;&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">If you go straight following the North Gate over there, you'll see Casidhe's Stand. Cardis is stationed there, and should have more information. &lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;&amp;quot;Got it.&amp;quot;&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
