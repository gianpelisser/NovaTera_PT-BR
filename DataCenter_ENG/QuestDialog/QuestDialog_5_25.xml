        <Page social="5">The tuwangis keep wandering out of their area. It was all fine and good until they started attacking our soldiers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There's just nothing to be done about them! I can't talk to them, but killing them seems...extreme. They're almost people!&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Is there no other way?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="5">Well, now that you mention it, I've heard rumors from herb gatherers here and there that there is actually a potion that allows the drinker to speak the tuwangi language.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If the ingredients I heard were right, I'll need {@LinkCreature:205#1023#Quagmire Herb Sap} and {@LinkCreature:5#5#Muddy Sporewalker Mucus}.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not pleasant to handle, but easy enough to find. What do you say?</Page>
