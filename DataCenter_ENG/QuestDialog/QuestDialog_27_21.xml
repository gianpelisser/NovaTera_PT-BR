        <Page social="5">My husband, {@LinkCreature:227#1019#Jordal}, recently joined the garrison. We had little time for farewells. Would you take this necklace to him at &lt;font color='#660000'&gt;Castra Mysterium&lt;/font&gt;?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tell him that he is loved and constantly in my thoughts.</Page>
