        <Page social="4">The agent greets you, &lt;PCNAME&gt;, and delivers a message from the god Saleron himself.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Recently, Salron has let us know that he wanted to see you, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. We don't know what the God plans to discuss with &lt;PCNAME&gt;. However, when a god calls a mortal by name, it is highly discouraged to ignore such a request.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Ah, &lt;PCNAME&gt;, of whose courage and nobility even I have heard. It seems my message has reached you?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I called you here to give you a kind of gift. Don't think of it as a reward. Just know that one day, when I rise from this cold prison, I will need strong allies.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In my opinion, you have a good chance of living up to that point.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If one day the Valkyon Federation will rule the world, I will need an agent I can trust.</Page>
