        <Page social="0">You helped restore {@Rgn:47001$$Tirkai Forest} and advanced Yasring's and the Mysterium's argon research in {@Rgn:45001$$Thrallhold}. Ronalt, curious about the life energy coming from some argon structures tried to purify argonified animals, but failed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You witnessed the transformation of small argons into other forms, including inanimate buildings. The Mysterium asked you to find out more about this. You went to meet Yasring, but couldn't find her.</Page>

Mmm...I'm hungry.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some armor fragments were on their way, but are just a bit overdue.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I hope they weren't attacked. Will you look for the shipment at the rendezvous site? Churimon should be with it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll just find some lunch.</Page>
