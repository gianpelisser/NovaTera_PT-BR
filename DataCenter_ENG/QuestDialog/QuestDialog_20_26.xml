        <Page social="4">My brother was one of many miners who never came home. Those monsters...they've probaby killed them all by now.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But at least I have his pick to remember him by. I wish I could give something back to the families of the other lost miners.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Say, if you come across any miner...remains...in there, could you gather their belongings? I know it would be a great comfort to their families.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Give any personal effects you find to Nemuro at Utterdark Outpost. He'll take care of the rest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It would mean so much to all of us.</Page>
