I try to keep an eye on everything around here, but I'm no Balder. I can't see everything.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Check with {@LinkCreature:212#1001#Munam}. Don't let the gruff act fool you.

        <Page social="4">Did you say that you’re here on Wynne’s request? What do you mean the children have disappeared? There are so many things happening, I haven’t received a report on that one yet. There was a child wandering around here a few days ago. Why don’t you ask the guards as you look around the campsite? I’m sorry I’m not much of a help. Anway, it’s great to have you back in one piece.</Page>
