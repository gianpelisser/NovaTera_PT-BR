I can already tell this is going to be a lucrative partnership, am I right?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hemming, over in Faevine Vale, wants some &lt;font color='#660000'&gt;cloud mushrooms&lt;/font&gt;. I'm a mycologist, so that's usually my thing. But the redcaps have taken over the valley, and I can't get near the place!&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Redcaps, shmedcaps."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">That's the spirit! Just grab the mushrooms and take them to Hemming with my regards&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Keep his payment. I've cultivated Hemming as a long-term customer, so you're entitled to a little "hazard pay."</Page>
