        <Page social="0">You went to the Temple of Dagon on Fraya's orders, and found the expedition team there searching for a rumored treasure which would help finance the cost of the Argon War.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After an exhaustive search of the temple, you obtained the Cerulean Gem, key to Dagon's resurrection, and turned it over to the expedition team.</Page>

        <Page social="5">I'm glad you're here, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. Don't ask me how we know this, but the nagas have been hiding away treasure somewhere in the Temple of Dagon, presumably to use as an offering.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We have a better use for it. The argons aren't going anywhere, and the treasury's running dry. The federation is looking at...creative solutions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We've sent out an expedition team to search the temple, but they're going to need reinforcements. I'd like to send you.</Page>

        <Page social="5">You can't know how grateful we are to see you here. Not only is the temple much larger than we expected, but the nagas and their friends are proving to be formidable foes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From what we've been able to find out, there are two treasure caches on two different floors. One is somewhere near here, and the other—the big one—is all the way down where Dagon is sleeping.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'm afraid we don't know more than that, but we need those treasures, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. The federation needs them.</Page>

        <Page social="4">You brought the treasure! Let's see what's here!&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Anything valuable?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">Yes, but not nearly as much as we'd hoped. We have to find that lower treasure—this will scarcely be enough to buy a hundred suits of good armor.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There's another camp on the next level down. Talk to Wekrine down there—they've been formulating plans for getting to the lower levels.</Page>

        <Page social="5">Nedisia sent you? Excellent. We've covered every corner of this level without finding anything.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can &lt;PCNAME&gt; handle the Dagonite templars in the Chamber of Mighty Souls? And bring back some naga leather.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Naga leather?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">Yes. The skin is tough enough to make into armor, and has magical properties as well. It sells for a high price in Allemantheia.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As long as you'll be fighting them anyway, there's no need to waste the opportunity for enriching the federation's coffers.</Page>

        <Page social="4">These are exquisite. And the money we receive from selling them will help the war effort. Well done, &lt;PCNAME&gt;.</Page>

    <Text huntingZoneId="242" id="10" prevId="8" villagerId="1038">
         
        <Page social="5">Naga leather, she says. Yes, it's terribly expensive, but it won't make a dent in the cost of this war.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But I believe the Cerulean Gem is here in this temple. It's not only the most valuable thing we could hope to find, but the mekonaris think it will speed up the process of Dagon's resurrection. That means we must keep it away from them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There may be more treasure, also. Keep your eyes open.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Look at these! Magnificent! Worth billions of pieces of naga leather.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;By the way, &lt;PCNAME&gt;, my scout says the nagas have hidden the Relic of Dagon in Dagon's Chantry. If that's true, they may be getting ready to resurrect him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We have to get that gem.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"What can I do?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">We're pretty sure Dagon's Chantry is at the very bottom of the temple, but we don't have any idea where.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One of the mekonaris—Resaltuuk, the Priest of Renewal—has a book that tells the exact location. You'll probably have to take it from his corpse.</Page>

    <Text huntingZoneId="242" id="13" prevId="11" villagerId="1038">
         
        <Page social="4">The Book of Rituals! Now we can find Dagon's Chantry!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes, here. But it's shielded somehow.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Look, there's a menhir in the central hall on the third level. Perhaps that's how they get in and out.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When you get inside, &lt;PCNAME&gt;, don't expect it to be easy. They'll have their most powerful warriors guarding that place. Take them out and search the room for that gem.</Page>

        <Page social="0">The Book of Rituals. Do you have it yet?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We can't find Dagon's Chantry without it.</Page>

        <Page social="4">So this is it—the Cerulean Gem. This gemstone alone is equal to all the riches in Allemantheia.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And there's an undeniable power here, too. The Mysterium will be very interested.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now the federation will have the means to fight the argons, and we owe it to you, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. This was among the treasures we liberated, and I'd like you to have it. It's little enough compared to what you've done, but I hope you'll find some value in it. Use it well.</Page>
