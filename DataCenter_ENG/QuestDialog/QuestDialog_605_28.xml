That's why we called you here.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Hands of Velika is a merchant group like no other. You see, in times like these, the Hands feel that upstanding members of society who wish to live to a ripe old age must wear many hats.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Velika's big and there's lots that needs doing during war times.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Your talents would be paramount to our causeâ€”which is also your cause, &lt;PCNAME&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Will you help us?</Page>
