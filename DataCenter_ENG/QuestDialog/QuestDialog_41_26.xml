        <Page social="0">Most of the older orcans don't believe there can be peace for us. They want to go on making war on the federation forever. &lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Yet you feel differently. Why?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="0">Karba and other wise orcans have helped us see a new way. Karba says it's no wonder the federation thinks of us as animals, when we act like animals.

Show it to the orcans near the arena. If they believe what we do, they'll understand.</Page>
