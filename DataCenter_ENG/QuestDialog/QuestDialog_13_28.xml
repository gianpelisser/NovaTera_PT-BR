        <Page social="4">This is a welcome surprise! I've been walking around, trying to think of how to complete my research on this magnificent tree structure here. Every time I set these instruments up, these stonebeaks come and steal them. I wonder why....&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyway, thank you very much for your help.</Page>

        <Page social="0">Adria said someone was out recovering my instruments. Is that you? I ask because you don't seem to have what the {@LinkCreature:13#301194#stonebeak highcrests} stole.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you have occasion to hit them with weapons or something, I'd really appreciate getting those instruments back...</Page>
