        <Page social="4">I know you came back here to help find Elleon, but I'll be blunt: we had a lot of shell-shocked survivors come back here...survivors that should have stayed in their hospital beds.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Don't get me wrong. I want you to find Elleon, but I don't want to someday be trying to find you. We need to make sure you're fully recovered and ready for combat.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Speak with &lt;font color='#660000'&gt;Centurion Barsabba&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If that old warhorse says you're ready for duty, that's good enough for me.</Page>
