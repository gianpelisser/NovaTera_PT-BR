        <Page social="4">The devas around here are sporting some new weapons, different than the others. I figure, if it's good enough for them, it's twice as good for us.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Take out {@LinkCreature:3#300141#devan blademasters}, {@LinkCreature:3#19#brigands}, or {@LinkCreature:3#18#scrappers} and collect their armaments. If their weapons are enchanted, better we have them. Don't mess this up. The folks back home are counting on us.</Page>
