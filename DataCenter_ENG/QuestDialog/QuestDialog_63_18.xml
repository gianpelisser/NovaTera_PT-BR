         <Page social="4">Hey... I still can't believe that my scouting group is gone ... But giving up is not a choice, I'm trying my best for the sake of every single living being of Arborea, to prevent another tragedy like the one that happened last time! Recruitment announcements for adventurers ready to help are being spread all over Velika! I even vetured on my own to the newly discovered power sources locations: Ravenous Gorge and Bathysmal Rise. It happened accidentally, I merely wanted to honor the memory of my fallen comrades and went to the Argon's Lands, but on the way, suddenly, I've been overwhelmed by an immense sense of fear, I couldn't move for quite a while. At that moment I was wandering across northern Arun, in search for someone to ferry me across the water, and only those two places were in the immediate vicinity ... You should check them out, be be careful, okay?</Page>
