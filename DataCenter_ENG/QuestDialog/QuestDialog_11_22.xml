        <Page social="4">I understand a healthy amount of caution where the Red Lash pirates are concerned. But if we don't get our fishing operations up and running again, it'll be a race to see whether we starve or go broke first.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You don't exactly look like fishing material to me.

I meant "you."</Page>
