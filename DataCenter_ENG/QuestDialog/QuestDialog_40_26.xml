        <Page social="4">Ever since the {@LinkCreature:40#11#selvaras scouts} appeared, people have been disappearing. Perhaps they're being sold into slaveryâ€”certainly no one has asked for ransom.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Killing a few of them might make them think again, so I'm offering a ransom for any identifying tokens you find on the bodies.</Page>

        <Page social="4">You didn't see any of the missing people? None at all?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That means they're probably already far away.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you for helping, though.</Page>
