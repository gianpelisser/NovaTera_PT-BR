        <Page social="5">You're very lucky. Not many get the chance to rub shoulders with a world-famous scholar such as myself. Don't feign shock! You know my name! Everyone knows my name.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As it happens, I do have a need for an assistant. There are a number of relics I'm after.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They're not lostâ€”I know precisely where they are. I'll mark them on your map! See? &lt;font color='#0080FF'&gt;&lt;A href="markmap:loc=7011#35885.3086,-52341.7695,1646.3262&amp;type=1&amp;name=Relic location"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"You need me to collect them?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>

Precisely!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You bring me those relics and I'll make sure you're invited to stand near the building where I give my glorious report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Time is fame, as they say, so don't dawdle.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll be here, doing important things....</Page>

        <Page social="5">Splendidly done. I should consider hiring someone like you more often. This will show those stuffed shirts at the Mysterium how foolish they were to turn away me, Eustace, from their ranks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At least, I really hope it does. Although it may take me some time to look over these finds.</Page>
