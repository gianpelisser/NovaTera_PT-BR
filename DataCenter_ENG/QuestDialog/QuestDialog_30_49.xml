        <Page social="1">People everywhere crave a physical connection to Balder's Refuge. The spot where Balder died so the world could be saved has a spiritual resonance...one we can exploit.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We can't take the ruins away, but the vegetation is another matter...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Are you picking up what I'm putting down?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Unfortunately, yes. You need something. "&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="1">Yes I do. &lt;font color='#0080FF'&gt;&lt;A href="markmap:loc=7015#-14741.8672,86906.8828,-441.2695&amp;type=1&amp;name=Lamenting Grass"&gt;Lamenting grass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, to be exact. This unusual plant only grows near Lok's Spearâ€”the very weapon Lok used in the battle that killed him and Shakan. The spear has been stuck in the ground since that fateful day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So, just collect some grass in a bottle, I'll label it with a bit of doggerel, like "Life thrives, even in a place of death," and we sell the idea of the spear by just mowing the grass.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It's corny, sure, but in wartime, people cling to sentimental crap like that.</Page>

        <Page social="1">See? Gathering grass is much simpler than killing a god, to pick an example totally at random.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Take this as payment, and bring back more grass when you think of it.</Page>

        <Page social="0">Business is all about timing the market, so let's get rich while everyone wants a piece of Balder's Refuge. Go to Lok's Spear and pick some grass. What could be easier?</Page>
