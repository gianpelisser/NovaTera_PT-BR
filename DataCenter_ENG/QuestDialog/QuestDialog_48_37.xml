        <Page social="4">We just blasted the last of the rock a few hours ago.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The argons made regular supply and relief missions difficult to execute, particularly getting into and out of Kanstria.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"What's that? A town?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">Kanstria? Yeah. Lots of castanics settled there.

I want you to take this flight stone to their flight master. That'll get them going again.</Page>
