        <Page social="4">Greetings, outlander. Welcome to our land.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am sorry to say that I have not seen any sort of apparatus which might somehow affect the Storm Barrier, but I suspect that only their most trusted officers would know where it might be found.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hm. As luck would have it, there is a high-ranking officer in their cave camp, just inside the Verdantfire Rift. Follow the path just over the hill, then look to your left. You should see the cave entrance.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Leave it to me."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
