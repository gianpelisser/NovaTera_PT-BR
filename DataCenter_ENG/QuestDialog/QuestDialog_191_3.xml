        <Page social="0">Paesyn tried to atone for Zolyn's capture, but ended up needing his own rescue. You calmed him down and helped get the supplies to Tempest Outpost.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Paesyn went ahead. Crazy furball kept saying 'It's my fault. It's all my fault.'&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Where did he go?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0">He grabbed those wrenches of his and charged across the valley, sabertooths be damned. Maybe he went to protect the supply wagons.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Watch out for him. Great engineer, but not much of a fighter.</Page>

        <Page social="4">&lt;PCNAME&gt;! I-I wanted to save her. I wanted to protect Zolyn, but I failed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My heart feels so heavy. I'm no hero. I just like to tinker with mechanical things. It's my fault she was captured.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"No, it's not."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="4">Yes, it is. She needed a hero, not a friend.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I bet we can find her together, though. You're strong and I'm brave, at least a little bit.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let's get these wagons moving, then find Zolyn.</Page>
