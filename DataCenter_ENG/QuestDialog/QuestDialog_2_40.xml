        <Page social="0">Even the unicorns have been corrupted by the ill wind that blows through the Fey Forest. I know Lillix had some luck helping Seravy, but the other unicorns are too fragile to survive such a transition.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I see your eyes, &lt;PCCLASS:lcase&gt;.

        <Page social="4">The unicorns' pure spirits could not endure such corruption. But they say a little bit of each unicorn remains in its horn.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Who knows?
