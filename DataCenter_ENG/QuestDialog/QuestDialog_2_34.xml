        <Page social="4">You're definitely a cure for our centaur problem, but there's no cure for the idiocy of certain loggers. Like &lt;b&gt;Siravon&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I sent him to repair the bridge south of Faevine Vale, and that idiot left without his tools!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'd send one of my loggers, but the roads are dangerous...and you're here.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Care to bring Siravon the tools he should have had all along?</Page>
