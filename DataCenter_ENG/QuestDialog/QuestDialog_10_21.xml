        <Page social="0">Yeah, Latas isn't the most diplomatic soldier here. But tongues get sharp when the mind gets dull, and we're all exhausted.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We've been trying to keep the Boan Strand, Kerozen Isle, and the Adderkin Jungle clear of hostiles, and it's just too much ground to cover. We'll be able to put you to good use.</Page>
