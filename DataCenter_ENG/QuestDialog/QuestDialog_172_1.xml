        <Page social="4">[Seir]&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My dear friend,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Mysterium traced the recent demokron incursions to Northern Arun, and believe we can send a force to investigate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You have never failed the Valkyon Federation, so I call upon you again to lend us your skill. Dougal will lead this mission, but he'll need someone tough to do the dangerous part.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We have developed a new airship called a Sky Ark. It will ferry your mission to the north. I need you to check on the supplies, then report aboard the sky ark.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nari, down at the docks, is expecting you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;~Seir</Page>

        <Page social="4">Isn't it wonderful? So much bustle and activity!&lt;BR&gt;What can I do for you?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Seir sent me to you."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">I see. You're going north aboard the sky ark? That's great!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It's much more powerful than our normal airships.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bound for Northern Arun and adventure! Doesn't it make your heart race?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Where exactly is this sky ark?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">See it there, hovering to the west?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Listen, the sky ark won't leave for the next couple of hours, but I could use some help.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"What do you need?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="0">We're coordinating supplies for the sky ark, but we've hit a few snags.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lojemoon can put you to work. It's all for your new mission! Done talking.</Page>

        <Page social="4">A sight for sore eyes! If we don't get these supplies loaded, my fur will fall out!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The supply wagon left before we could get the emberbloom oil. Burns slow and doesn't smoke, which makes it ideal for airships.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"How much do you need?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="0">Not much! Not much!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;See those sheep? They love to eat emberblooms. Pick a few flowers and bring them to me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll do the rest.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Correct!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A trader named Tonas just left for the airship platform. His wagon's quite slow though, so you can probably catch up.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"That's all?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>

        <Page social="4">I didn't see it. It just came out of nowhere and smacked my wagon.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The horses panicked and tore their harnesses free.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Perhaps I can help."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="4">I'm grateful, but the impact cracked my axles. I need to fix the wagon first.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The trouble is, I don't have anything to improvise for the repair.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"So you need wood?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="0">Yes! Those ghilliedhus or mycanars might do the trick, but not without a fight.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I need a handful of strong boughs. See what you can do while I find my tools.</Page>

They ate some supplies, cracked my seat, and made me soil my pants before my guards drove them off!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I need to make up for the lost food.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Would bear meat do?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="0">Hah! It would indeed. Velik bless you!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you, thank you so much!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You bring me some meat and I'll get these axles fixed.</Page>
