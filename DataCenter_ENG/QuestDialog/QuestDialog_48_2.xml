        <Page social="0">Tamur came to you with a problem. Kaia, heartbroken by the tremendous number of casualties, decided to risk her life in a bold strike on the argons in the Khanovar Gauntlet. Tamur begged you to intercede, pointing out that Kaia could be killed, which would shatter troop morale. Kaia refused to change her mind, but agreed to take you and Hasmina into battle. You fought heroically, but the sheer number of argons overwhelmed even Kaia's strength. Kaia reluctantly retreated, much to Tamur's relief.</Page>

        <Page social="10">True enough.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We've another crisis at the moment, though. {@Creature:248#2010$$Kaia} insists on taking the field in an attempt to end this war.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You of all people know the gods can die as easily as any mortal. We can't lose Kaia. It would shatter morale!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do me a favor-try to talk her out of it.</Page>
