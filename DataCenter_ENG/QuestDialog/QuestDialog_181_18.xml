        <Page social="4">Welcome back, &lt;PCNAME&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have been informed of your loss, and you have my promise that Highwatch will do everything it can to help you find Captain Zolyn.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The immediate concern, though, is the teleportal. I believe that all of the conditions are right for reactivating it—and I wanted you to have the honor.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My friend, please place a Relativity Stone in the repository, and re-open Highwatch's teleportal!&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"It would be my honor. Thank you."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
