        <Page social="4">The jalmaraks were once charged with guarding the Staff of Isren. No one knows why they betrayed the faerie, but that's just what they did.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What concerns me, however, is the number of dracoloths lumbering around the Plaza of the Fallen. Dracoloths are powerful foes, treacherous and tempermental.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I suspect Thulsa's hands behind their presence. Either way, they must die.</Page>
