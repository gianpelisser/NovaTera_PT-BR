        <Page social="4">We've lost contact with our cousins in Crescentia. The devas surged past our camps and cut off the town, and the trade that goes with it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Head east, through the cave and report to {@LinkCreature:203#1004#Neacal} at Bulwark Camp. Do what you can to assist him. If you're half as much help in Oblivion Woods as you were here, they'll be just fine.</Page>

Normally, they confine themselves to Deva Silva, but something got into them recently.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They're tough and cunning, but with your help, we might just knock 'em back.</Page>
