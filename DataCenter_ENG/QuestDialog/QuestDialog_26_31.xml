        <Page social="5">Ancient guardians bar the way of progress. Their task is noble but time hasn't been kind to them. They damage the very thing they were charged to protect.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If we're to understand and harness the Fountain of Shara, the {@LinkCreature:26#3001#soulkeepers} and {@LinkCreature:26#3002#hallowed sentinels} must be destroyed.
