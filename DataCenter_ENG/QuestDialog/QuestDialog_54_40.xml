        <Page social="4">For eons, the faeries of Seeliewood never worried about dangers dropping in from aboveâ€”up until the day emberheart dracoloths broke through their protective shield. Now the fey are constantly battling illness, argons, and all the other threats to their sacred land.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I don't care why the dracoloths decided to land here. I'm more concerned about how they got through.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have a theory: there must be something special about the hides of the dracoloths. Would you bring me some to examine?</Page>

        <Page social="4">Thank you for these.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This emberhide could teach me a lot about how the dracoloths circumvented the magic barriers. Or I just might get a fancy new suit out of it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you in either case.</Page>
