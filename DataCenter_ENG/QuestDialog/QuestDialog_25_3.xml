        <Page social="0">A familiar face waited for you in Cultists' Refuge. Jelena greeted you with enthusiasm.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Elleon, however, was nowhere in sight, and Jelena explained that the team was split up by a mysterious force after using the teleportal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jelena also explained she was injured in the process and barely escaped with the help of her younger sister.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After Jelena asked you to help her sister, you learned Elleon had gone deeper in pursuit of Lok cultists.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You went after Elleon and infiltrated the Cultists' Refuge, then joined forces with Elleon and defeated Priestess Akia and her servant, Terkasia.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You then destroyed Samael's soul stone, with which Akia was planning to resurrect Samael.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This ended the conflict with the Cult of Lok.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Jelena was injured but took the time to send word for you, then followed Elleon through the portal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let's hope both reckless hearts avoided death once more.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Blast and fire, I am glad to see you, &lt;PCNAME&gt;! I haven't found Elleon yet, but I need your help! My twin sister, Davina, is among the missing. I wasn't strong enough to stay with her.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It gets worse. The Scions of Lok are crawling all over this place, but there's another group here—Atel Akaad. I've never heard of them, and that worries me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'm not strong enough to go with you, but we need to find our friends—find Davina. Please!</Page>

        <Page social="4">This place is a maze! Don't know where Elleon vanished to, but we last saw Davina to the east. Unfortunately, the doors slammed down and cut us off.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you can use the {@LinkCreature:489#1008#Eastern Wardstone}, you can open the eastern door and rescue Davina!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Done talking. Start killing.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Oh, thank you! I can't believe I was captured so easily. I'm just glad Jelena didn't see me like this.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Elleon stepped through that western doorway in the central hall, but it slammed shut before I could follow! I could hear him fighting off a whole horde of cultists.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The guards said the {@LinkCreature:489#1011#Western Wardstone} just east of here opens the door, but be careful. {@LinkCreature:489#3609#Galanos} is guarding the stone.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Thank you for rescuing Davina! Oh, I could kiss you!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If Elleon's gone west, that's where you need to head next.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Akia—remember her?—is rallying the Scions of Lok and working with these Atel Akaad creeps.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nullu's been mapping the place. She'll steer you right to Akia. Find her and end her!</Page>

        <Page social="4">You can't kill Akia until you kill Terkasia. Go find Akia in the &lt;font color='#0080FF'&gt;&lt;A href="markmap:loc=9089#70422.2422,37561.2188,-9149.4219&amp;type=1&amp;name=Priest's Chamber"&gt;priest's chamber&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/font&gt; in the western section.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She's very cunning. Expect the unexpected.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Find the treacherous script and summon {@LinkCreature:489#3802#Terkasia}. Only then can this be ended.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Sorry I was running behind. Too many cultists around here. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Looks like you didn't need me, anyway. A resurrected Samael—knowing all our secrets, but beyond our reach—would have been a disaster.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This altar shouldn't stand any longer. Its very existence keeps Samael's spirit from the Dream, ready to come back whenever some wild-eyed cultists beckon.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Would you do the honors? Set these explosives around {@LinkCreature:489#100#Samael's soul stone} and end this once and for all.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Me?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="4">More than anyone, you've fought this battle. Seems only fitting that you bring it to its conclusion.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Akia and Terkasia are dead, and the remaining Scions are scattered, leaderless.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We have new enemies, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. Those Ksharans are argons. That's plain enough. But this "Atel Akaad" group...it seems like the Cult of Lok was just their puppet.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bah! Enough ruminating. Someone owes us a great number of drinks!</Page>
