        <Page social="0">(This book appears to be the Centurion's journal. It contains stories about an evil cult that's behind the gulas and about how the cultists brought {@LinkCreature:9#1400#Azarel's juggernaut} and {@LinkCreature:9#1410#labyrinthine stalkers} here. One particular entry stands out. It says these monsters can be defeated by pulling out their teeth.)</Page>

I once received a report about the maze monster, but I wasn't sure if we could even get through its protectors.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Obviously the monster shows the level of threat we're facing, and our risk has doubled since the cultists are in cooperation with the gulas.</Page>
