        <Page social="0">That must be why the argons took Kelsaik's corpse. I had no idea part of Sikander remained within Kelsaik—and I have no idea what she's planning to do with it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Manahan, you created something so heartless. No wonder Arun and Shara locked you up.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Wait...who's Manahan?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="0">Manahan is an ancient name, &lt;PCNAME&gt;...a name best forgotten.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Focus on the task at hand. Sikander's flame is the embodiment of creation itself. Think of the Core...then multiply it by a thousand.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In Shandra Manaya's hands, Sikander's flame could destroy as well as create. Track Shandra Manaya down and retrieve Sikander's flame at all costs!</Page>

        <Page social="1">I felt Shandra Manaya's death—a wave of pain that rippled across the world. The Argon War is over, and we won!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The whole world owes you its very existence. You did what no one else, god or mortal, could do. Hail &lt;PCNAME&gt;, destroyer of argons, vanquisher of gods, champion of the Valkyon Federation!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the coming months, we'll try to figure out why Shandra Manaya wanted Sikander's flame. I have my suspicions, but the important thing is that Shandra Manaya's plan died when she did.</Page>
