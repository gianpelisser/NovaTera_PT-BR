        <Page social="0">The Valkyon Federation has mostly pulled out of the Island of Dawn, but a few unlucky folks are left behind, trying to clean up what little mess remains. They asked if you'd help them so they could speed up their exit, and you accepted.</Page>

        <Page social="4">I don't know why they sent you here. Honestly, it might have been a joke. That's what this place is now.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You may as well check in with Legate &lt;font color='#660000'&gt;Lam&lt;/font&gt; now that you're here, though. You can help us wrap up.</Page>

We could use some help getting this place cleared out.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I could have told you from the start that the federation wasn't going to be able to hold it together. All that unity crap was just talk.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You ready to help us get out of here?</Page>
