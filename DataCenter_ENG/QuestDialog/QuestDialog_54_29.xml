But did you know centaur wardens and pranksome redcaps were duty bound to guard and tend her garden?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The goddess's power must be waning, because now they're wandering Seeliewood instead of doing their duty in the garden.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bring me the bands that Isren used to bind them to their duty.
