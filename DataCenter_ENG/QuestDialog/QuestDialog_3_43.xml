        <Page social="4">Parlan asked me to help him with his research, but his request is slightly insane. He wants me, ME, to bring him some ghilliedhu roots.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I can barely weed a garden, I'm not about to go toe-to-toe with a growling, walking tree. Could you go into the northern Bestial Vale and collect roots from {@LinkCreature:3#3#Mossy Ghilliedhus}?</Page>

        <Page social="4">You're a lifesaver, &lt;PCNAME&gt;!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is just what Parlan wants. Would you mind taking them to him? I've some notes to finish on some other flora.</Page>

        <Page social="0">I'm pretty sure Parlan only wants roots from {@LinkCreature:3#3#Mossy Ghilliedhus}. I doubt I could fool him with a substitute.</Page>

        <Page social="4">&lt;PCNAME&gt;! Good to see you again. And you brought ghilliedhu roots? Excellent!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It's all part of my elixir research. It's dangerous, I know, but a priest or mystic isn't always around to save the fallen. A potion that could do it would be a treasure beyond price for the Valkyon Federation!</Page>
