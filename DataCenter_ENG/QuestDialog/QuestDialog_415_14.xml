The cliff tops are crawling with demons, and we've already taken casualties.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We could retreat, but that would just lure the demons down onto the beach, and they'd slaughter us.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instead, we advance! If we can win a battle or two up here, we can fool the demons into thinking we're a fighting force to be reckoned with. They can't press an advantage that they don't know they have!</Page>
