        <Page social="6">This region is only now beginning to come to life after the Day of Fire. Many creatures are nearly out of danger of extinction.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unfortunately, that is not the case for the struthios. There are too few of them, and too many hyenas. Perhaps &lt;PCNAME&gt; would care to redress the balance in favor of the struthios?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You'll find them southwest of here. And be forewarnedâ€”they're every bit as deadly as the hyenas who hunt them.</Page>
