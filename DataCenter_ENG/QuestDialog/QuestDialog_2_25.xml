        <Page social="4">Taking care of refugees is all well and good, but it'd be better if we turned them back into "people with homes and jobs," eh?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And that means extending our reach beyond Fey Forest into the rest of the region.

        <Page social="4">Maon used to keep the peace between us and the feyâ€”you know, the faeries, the centaurs, and all the other forest creatures.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not his fault, but it's a bloody business now.
