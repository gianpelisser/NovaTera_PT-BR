        <Page social="5">My chief engineer left for Wyvern Watch this morning. I know he wanted to stop on his way and see some of those giants' constructs at the northeast end of the craters. That little guy sure loves machines.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now I'm wondering if I should have let him go. I couldn't spare a guard, and Poihon's not as fierce as some poporis I've known.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you go that way, will you look for him?</Page>

        <Page social="6">It was good of Adamael to worry about me. I did stop to watch Dredkreak. He's right over there to the southwest. Magnificent engineering!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'd give a lot to be able to study him in one piece, but I'll settle for a handful of intact parts, if you can get them for me.</Page>
