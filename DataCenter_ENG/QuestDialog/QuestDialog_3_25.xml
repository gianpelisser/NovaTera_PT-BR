        <Page social="4">I'm not the only one who needs your help. Several peddlers got stuck in Blood Run. Their wagons are stolen or wrecked, but the peddlers could still get their goods to Crescentia if someone would escort them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even a little shipment would be a real relief. You're looking for the {@LinkCreature:203#1028#peddler} east of here. Hurry up and don't let him die!</Page>

I don't have to tell you how heartening such little victories can be.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Crescentia's enduring a dark time right now, but we'll get through it. Thank you.</Page>
