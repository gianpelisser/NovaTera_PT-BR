        <Page social="0">The personification of the Core, on the verge of death, was about to lose control of the Core's massive energies. Elleon remembered that Akasha was going to transfer the Core's power to herself, so she constructed a device for exactly that purpose. You, Fraya, and Elleon found the transfer device within the Golden Labyrinth and defeated Akasha's underlings there. Then Fraya sacrificed her mortal self, using the device to become one with the Core and stabilize it.</Page>

        <Page social="5">Serion's control of the Core's energy is slipping. I don't know how much longer he'll last. The last time we lost control of the Core's energy, we devastated half a continent. We need to contain it before that happens.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Got a container in mind?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="5">...There are options. I'm considering the situation. But it'll take enormous power to contain the Core. Serion could supply that power if he was under control, but as things stand, we need another power source. Find something—quickly!</Page>

        <Page social="5">Replacement energy—did you just say that?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I tried to stop her, but she is going to do that anyway.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Who's going to do what?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="5">Who could become the Core? It means sacrificing everything. Like Serion, the next Core will live for Allemantheia forever, neither dead nor alive.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Once she's done it, there's no going back.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Wait...she?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="0">Forget I said that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It's all speculative unless we can get enough energy to move the Core from one body to another.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Akasha might have held the key—she wanted the Core's power, so she must have had a power source capable of doing it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Somewhere in the Golden Labyrinth at the heart of the Hungry Caverns.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tell Fraya we're going after it!</Page>

        <Page social="5">Akasha may be gone, but her minions are still guarding the Golden Labyrinth. Still, some chance is better than no chance at all.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;PCNAME&gt;, catch up with Elleon, then seize that device. Once you've done so, use this token to contact me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tribune Sophilia will know the safest path into the Golden Labyrinth.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Your way is too easy, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. I'm going by another path, just in case we need a quick retreat route.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"You'll want this, then."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="0">Commander Fraya's token...right.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Contact her when we seize the Core transfer device...got it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oh, I see. You're giving me this to make sure I show up where I'm supposed to, rather than wandering off...very clever, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. You know me too well.</Page>

        <Page social="5">We haven't reached the Core transfer device yet, but we have a good idea of where it is. In the meantime, you have an urgent summons.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No, from Jelena, not Elleon.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She's fighting her way through the Chamber of Trials, and she needs your help.</Page>

        <Page social="5">Glad you could make it, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. If we can get through these chambers, it'll be easy to reach the device. But I can't get this door open.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There's a gatekeeper in the west passage, but I can't lure him over here for a fight.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Take this side passage; at the end is the {@LinkCreature:472#1012#east teleportal}. It will take you to the gatekeeper, {@LinkCreature:472#22#Berylheart}. I'll wait here and see if Berylheart's death opens the door. I'm afraid Elleon's going to do something stupid.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Head east to the Chamber of the Wild. Find the {@LinkCreature:472#1011#west teleportal}. That should take you inside.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The transfer device should be in there. There are bound to be lots of guards. I overheard the names {@LinkCreature:472#19#Varcerbus} and {@LinkCreature:472#5000#Valgmore}. Be careful!</Page>

        <Page social="5">I am trying to see the good. The one who sacrificed most seems to be most satisfied, so who am I to disagree? She had already made up her mind to sacrifice herself for Allemantheia—for our people.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I think of how hard I worked to avoid the burden of command, and I'm ashamed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fraya...the Core, I suppose, now...wants to thank you personally. Why don't you go see her?</Page>

The Core's people need its power, need the symbol of Fraya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Core must be beyond petty concerns, but...I cannot forget Kaidun. Beware, Akasha and Thulsa...this Core remembers, knows what she's sacrificed for.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you, &lt;PCNAME&gt;, for all you've done.</Page>
