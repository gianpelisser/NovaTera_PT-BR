        <Page social="0">Keezar, a Khirian shaman, was shrewd, but seemed out of her mind.&lt;BR&gt;Her ability was not reliable, but since she was the last hope to secure a working archdevan control pendant, there was no other choice but to trust her.</Page>

        <Page social="1">How do I know what? Who are you? Did the archdevas send you?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What's that you have there? A broken control pendant? How did you break this? They're meant to be indestructible and idiot-proof!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oh, well, the damage is done. The only way to put this back together now would be some sort of super-powerful glue. "Power Glue," call it.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Uh, okay. Do you have such a glue?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="1">Well, no, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. I need the archdevas to think that these pendants cannot be repaired, once they're brokenâ€”otherwise they'll have no further use of me. But now that the Vanguard Initiative have finally arrived, there's no need for me to remain here.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So, to make magical glue, you need magical horn. Say, the kind you'd find on devas. I'm sure you can find some of those.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I have a good idea..."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>

Ha! Bet you're wondering how I knew that, aren't you?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Is everyone here crazy?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>

        <Page social="1">No need to get snippy, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. I have waited years in this awful place just to help you on your quest! But now that you're here, we can both go.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let's talk outside, shall we?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"How do I get you out of here?" &lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
         
        <Page social="1">Click, click, double-quick! That's the wrong question! The right question is how do I get you out of here, when you're so slow?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"What? I'm not slow..."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>

Have I already asked you about your favorite color?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I need this pendant repaired. Remember?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
