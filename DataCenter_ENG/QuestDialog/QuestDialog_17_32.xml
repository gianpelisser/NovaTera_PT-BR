        <Page social="5">Nice thing about cultists? Not good at thinking for themselves! Keep doing whatever they're doing 'til someone stops 'em.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oh, don't give me that look. This'll be cub's play for you! {@LinkCreature:17#305#Heavens Fall dervishes} are the cult's pride and joy. Kill them, and the rest just stand there with those barrels over their heads and look stupid. Well, stupider.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Helpful tip? Easier to keep count if you take those amulets they all wear. I have fifty myself!</Page>

You've learned two lessons in soldiering and it seems I'm done with all my work for the week! I suggest we take a break. Nature knows we've both earned one!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You're all right, soldier.</Page>
