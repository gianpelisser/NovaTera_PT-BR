        <Page social="4">I'm going to strangle him! Gah!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Apologies, but you haven't seen Craxan, have you?

        <Page social="4">Balrug worries more than a wet nurse. Naturally, I'm fine.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The apprentices, however, haven't exactly covered themselves in glory. Pathetic.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As for me, I can't go back yet. Someone's counting on me.</Page>
