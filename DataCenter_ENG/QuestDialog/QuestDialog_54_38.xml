        <Page social="4">&lt;PCNAME&gt;, the Mysterium is very interested in how the argons penetrated Isren's garden.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Take this monitoring device and carry it with you inside. It will give the researchers out here informations about the argons you encounter.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That way, if we have to send another party in...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oh!
