        <Page social="4">I'm so distraught. My {@LinkCreature:216#1010#husband} was a wonderful man...then came the Ceremony of Blessing...he was so curious, he had to see.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He seemed nervous when he returned. He woke up screaming in the middle of the night. The same night many vampirs started to change.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please...find him. He may not have fully made the change. We may seem monstrous to you, but I assure you, we love the same as you.</Page>
