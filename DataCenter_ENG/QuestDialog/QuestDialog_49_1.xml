        <Page social="0">Commander Tamur ordered you and Hasmina to infiltrate Argonea in an effort to harry the argons' rear echelon, as well as reestablish contact with the town of Kanstria. Kanstria was cut off when the argons surrounded the town and disabled the flight platform, but you made it through the lines. The magistrate asked you to find several missing scouts. Hasmina led you to them, and the argons' troop transport portals. You recovered the fallen scouts' dog tags and delivered the bad news to Kanstria.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Listen, uh, I wanted to thank you for saving my life. I didn't think I'd make it out of the Three Towers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There's not much time. The fighting here has slowed down, so we're going to try an assault on the argons' rear echelon. First, we need to make contact with Kanstria. We lost touch with them after the last argon surge.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll meet you on the outskirts of the town.</Page>

        <Page social="4">See those reddish pillars? That's Kanstria. There should be a response force just out of sight.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The proximity of those kalashes worries me. Do you think the argons killed everyone? Are we too late?</Page>

        <Page social="12">The argons did something to our flight platform. It doesn't work, and we're cut off. We sent a patrol to Khanovar Citadel, but we never heard back from them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Look, you should really talk to the magistrate. Take this letter—I'll vouch for you. Good luck.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Hmm. Celtan vouches for you. That's good enough for me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Look, we haven't sat idle this whole time. I've sent anyone I could spare to link up with federation forces, but none came back. Finding them, or even what happened to them, would be a boon for our morale. Can you help us?</Page>

        <Page social="4">I heard him. I-I'm ready to go. There's a small overwatch north of here. I used to hide there when I was a little girl. If the scouts survived, I bet that's where they're hiding.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Head to the &lt;font color='#0080FF'&gt;&lt;A href="markmap:loc=8001#65883, 25758, 4896&amp;type=1&amp;name=Hill Near Melgatol Portal"&gt;Melgatol Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/font&gt;.

        <Page social="4">True enough. They didn't die cowards. That might give some comfort to their families, should we ever reestablish contact with the rest of the world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you for bringing back their tags. Only a fellow soldier knows how much that matters.</Page>
