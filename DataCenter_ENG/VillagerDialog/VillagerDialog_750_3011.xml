Just over there is the &lt;font color='#3255FC'&gt;Cliffside Airship Platform&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I use it to cross the rift when I need to, but I can set it up so that it will drop you off in the Garden of Yativioâ€”if you think you're ready.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Has anyone warned you about Yativio? It's the king of corpse flowers, and &lt;font color='#FF0000'&gt;when Yativio's body glows red, you'd better run.&lt;/font&gt;</Page>
