        <Page social="4">Looking for something? Just let me know. There may not be much because what the town is going through these days, but we can accommodate your needs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Have you heard? I've heard our town was once rich by trading with the Shurians a long time ago. But the Shurians started to act strangely, and now there are only a few traces of them ever even being here. Well, I like the town the way it is now, calm and safe.</Page>
