        <Page social="4">Did you know Isren once walked these woods? It was here that her daughter Icaruna came to mourn her death.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Poor Icaruna! Once so gentle. Her fate is a mystery. In one story, Sikander killed her in his madness after Isren's death. In another, the agony of grief consumed her. It's even said that Killian killed and ate her!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I pray to Oriyn that her soul will find peace.</Page>
