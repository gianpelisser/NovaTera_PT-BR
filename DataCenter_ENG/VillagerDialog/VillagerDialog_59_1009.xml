        <Page social="4">Crescentia may look peaceful from the outside, but we are actually in great danger. Everyone is asking for help from us because the devan brigands are threatening the safety of our town, and hyenas are appearing in farms near the Valley of Titans. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So I'm sorry, but if you are not here to help secure the safety of our town, then I have nothing else to say to you.</Page>
