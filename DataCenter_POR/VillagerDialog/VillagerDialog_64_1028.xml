        <Page social="4">All day long I deal with elves—if one of them calls me a "child" again, I won't be held responsible for my actions. And the baraka? They never get the joke. I don't mind the amani—they don't complain much—and I'll never figure out humans.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Don't cross a popori, though. I dueled one long ago...and still have the scar to prove it!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That's the federation for you. We're all happy drones...I mean citizens.</Page>
