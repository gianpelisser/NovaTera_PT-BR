        <Page social="14">The argon invasion has taken so much away from usâ€”we no longer have a place to call our homeland. We've settled here, but this is no more our home than Velika.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It's not just because we're constantly under attack, either. Our home had its share of attacks, but it was still ours.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This...this is just where we're staying. For now. I hope.</Page>
